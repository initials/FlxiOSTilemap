FlxTilemap
 for iOS

It's actually nothing like the Flash version.

The thing to note is that it builds a FlxTileBlock for each time it finds a non white pixel. The width is determined by the red value and the blue value, the green value can be used as an arbitrary value.

Pure green pixels are just for placeholders.
